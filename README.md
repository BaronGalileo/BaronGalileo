## About Me

👋 Hi there! My name is Dima Barantsov, and I’m passionate about **frontend development**. My goal is to create user-friendly, fast, and intuitive interfaces that make interacting with web applications enjoyable and simple.

### 🔧 What I Do:
- **Frontend Development:** I’m diving deep into React, Redux, as well as **SASS** and **TypeScript** to build modern and scalable solutions.
- **Backend (Familiarity):** Although I’m also familiar with **backend** technologies and have experience with Python and Django, I see them as tools to solve problems rather than as my primary focus.
- **Full-Stack (When Needed):** I work across both sides of development but focus primarily on the frontend.

### 🌱 Currently:
- Expanding my knowledge in **SASS**, **TypeScript**, and deepening my expertise in the React ecosystem.
- Improving my skills with API integration and backend technologies to work effectively with the frontend.

### 🚀 Goals:
- Build modern, responsive interfaces that enhance user experience.
- Continue deepening my knowledge of **frontend development** to become an expert in the field.
- Work on real-world projects and share my knowledge with the community.
